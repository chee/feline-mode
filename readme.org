The modeline is really noisy. The prettier ones add like 300ms to my emacs
start-up time. =feline-mode= is not noisy, it loads almost instantly.

With the built in mode-line the =global-mode-string= is usually pushed right off
the edge of the screen by minor modes. =feline-mode= does not show minor modes.

=feline-mode= shows the following items:

- =*=, if the buffer is modified
- the major mode (which can be aliased to save space)
- the buffer name
- the current =project.el= project, if there is one
- the line and column (looks like =L17C34=)
- the =global-mode-string= (useful details from other modes)
- evil state, if you use evil

** Configuration

Install it however you like! download it and put it in your =load-path=, or point
=elpaca= at this repo.

there are options. there are faces. see =M-x= =customize-group= =feline= :)
